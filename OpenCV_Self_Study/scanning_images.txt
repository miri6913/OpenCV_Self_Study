A simple color space reduction algorithm would consist of just passing through every pixel 
of an image matrix and applying this formula. 
It's worth noting that we do a divide and a multiplication operation. 
These operations are bloody expensive for a system. 
If possible it's worth avoiding them by using cheaper operations such as a few subtractions, 
addition or in best case a simple assignment. 
Furthermore, note that we only have a limited number of input values for the upper operation. 
In case of the uchar system this is 256 to be exact.
